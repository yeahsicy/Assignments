In this assignment, we are creating a php form that takes user input, but it does nothing with it. Later, we will use this form to enter data into a database.


?Create a wishlist "website" that has three pages: 


?a first page called index.php, which has a brief explanation of how the site functions, and any other images/styles you want to play with.


?a second page called create.php, where a user can go and create a new book that they want added to their database. The form should allow for the following fields (required fields marked *):


?name of book: "name"*
?name of author: "author"* 
?User should be able to pick a genre from the following (non-fiction, horror, mystery, classic, other): "genre"
?The ISBN # of the book, if known: "isbn" 
?And, of course, a submit button.


?a third page which displays a short confirmation message that the book has been added to the wishlist. Please include the book name etc. in the message (to demonstrate you are able to access and use the form data)


?Each of the pages must have a menu on the top using which you can browse to any page and a footer at the bottom (hint: think templates)
?If you have styles, create a directory called "styles" and put the css in that directory.
?If you have images, place them in a directory called "images" 
?If you have templates, place them in a directory called "templates"


TWO BONUS POINTS: For redirecting the user back to index.php after showing the confirmation page for a few seconds.
