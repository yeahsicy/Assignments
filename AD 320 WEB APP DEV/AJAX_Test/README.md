Using the AJAX example we reviewed in class, create a page which reads data from a file in your project and updates an HTML element in your page based on a user action without reloading the entire page.


You may use either vanilla JavaScript or jQuery (or both, if you'd like the practice), but make sure you


*capture a user event (e.g. mouse click, scroll, keyup etc.)


*react to that user event


BONUS point: use a callback function that executes after that event has occurred.
