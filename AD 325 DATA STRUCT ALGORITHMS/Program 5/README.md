Write two programs.  The first one must utilize a red black tree; the second must utilize an AVL tree.  Include code necessary for timing of the load of the tree, the time to add nodes, and the time to delete nodes.  There are three files added to this assignment.  The first (SBT1.txt) is for the initial load of the tree.  The second (SBT2.txt) is for the addition of nodes.  The third (SBT3.txt) is for the deletion of nodes.


It does not matter how you utilize the files since the timings should be places immediately adjacent to the code that either loads, add, or deletes nodes.  Provide the code and a report (console print is fine) for the timings for the three functions for each of the two trees.
