HW 3 - Big

Part One of Homework 3
Don't forget that your assignment must be linked from your Portal page! If your assignment is NOT LINKED from your portal page, you will have earned a grade of "0!"

Assignment three's topic will be your choice. Assignment requirements:

As always, validator badges and pages must validate
Folder hierarchy - big folder that will contain the home page (index.html) and your big page (big.html) and an images folder
Your main page will of course be named "index.html" and will be placed inside of a "big" folder
The content of your page will be placed inside your wrapper. With CSS, the width will be declared, as well as placement of the wrapper (centering the wrapper).
A small background image - if you're using a football theme, use a football, if a pet theme, use a dog paw.  The image must be optimized!
For this assignment, we will have a logo. Two theme related images, one image could be at least 400 pixels wide, and the other could be 300 pixels in width. One image will be placed right, the other, left. (The positioning of the images must be accomplished with CSS!)
Overflow hidden will be used for the wrapper - ONLY if needed!
Padding around the images
One h1 and one h2 and one h3
Two - three paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum.
One of your images will be "hot" - it will link to your second page which will be called big.html.
On your first and second page, you will include your copyright footer
Your copyright footer will be nested in an unordered list, displayed horizontally and centered
Perfect the index.html - validate it, confirm the colors, background colors, padding, font size and family before the next step!

Part Two of Assignment 3
Now, save your index.html page as your big.html page. By saving the index.html as the big.html, your big page now will display the same styles as your index.html.  It will also display the header and footer!
Your second page (big.html) will display your bigger image, centered on the page. Below the image, you will have one links returning the user to your original page (index.html).  Again, BOTH pages must validate.

HW 4 - Wireframe

Wireframes and Sitemap for your FINAL PROJECT WEBSITE!!!
You will be creating a "sitemap" for your FINAL PROJECT website. The sitemap is a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. It will show how these pages can be grouped.  Please refer to page 461 and 462 in our textbook.
You will also be creating a wireframe for your FINAL PROJECT home page and inner page of your website.  A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site.  It shows the hierarchy and placement of the information.

HW 5 - Form

You will create a form using the form elements we have learned in class.  They are:

The form element - don't forget that the form element has a method attribute and an action attribute!
The fieldset element - place a border around your form
The legend element - Name your form
The input element - tons of attributes!  You will be using the following input types:
Text
Email
Radio
Checkbox
Submit
And, don't forget the textarea for comments!
In order for your form to work, the form action's value must be declared.  I have supplied you with a formhandler.phpView in a new window  View in a new windowwhich will communicate to your form and send you a confirming email (Viola)!

IMPORTANT!
Please review the Rubric - your form MUST communicate with the formhandler.php, resulting in the end user receiving a confirming thank you page (thx.html)!

HW 6 - Template

Your Home and inner HTML page of your Final Project - error free with ONE external style sheet!

If you will have a rotating images banner (blueberry), or a lightbox, you will link to an additional .css file located in your css folder!

As always, validator badges and pages must validate
Appropriate title tags
ONE External Style Sheet - some embedded styles will be accepted
Consistent Navigation
Optimized images
Paths and links must be "relative" when linking to your own site
Descriptive "alt" tags, "title" tags must be used
