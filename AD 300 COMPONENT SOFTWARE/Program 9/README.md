Search the BST for the following numbers and indicate the depth they are found or when your program determines they are not found.  14, 95, 90, 35, 17, 63.

Provide the .java code and a printout showing the check for the above six numbers.

Program 9.2

Write Program 9.1, test it as described, and add the following.  After the check of the six numbers, add the following numbers to the BST:  34, 35, 37, 62.   Search the BST for the following numbers and indicate the depth they are found or when your program determines they are not found.   14, 95, 90, 35, 17, 63, 35, 62.

Provide the .java code and a printout showing the check for the above eight numbers.

Program 9.3

Write Program 9.2, test it as described, and add the following code.  Take the BST constructed in Program 9.2 and then rebuild it as a more balanced BST by finding the mid point value and placing the other nodes in order on both sides of the root. 

Search the BST for the following numbers and indicate the depth they are found or when your program determines they are not found.  14, 95, 90, 35, 17, 63, 35, 62.

Provide the .java code and a printout showing the check for the above eight numbers.
