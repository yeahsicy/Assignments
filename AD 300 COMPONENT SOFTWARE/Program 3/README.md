Using the file agile_manifesto.txtPreview the documentView in a new window, construct a Java program that read the file (please note there are multiple words on multiple lines-consider whitespace as a token delimiter).  Use a data structure of your own choosing to store the words and how many times they are used..  After reading and storing the file, print out all of the words in alphabetical order and how many times they are used.  Then print out all the words in order by the number of times they are used.  Finally, provide a short report on why you used the data structure you used.  I want you to tell me why you picked the data structure you did.
