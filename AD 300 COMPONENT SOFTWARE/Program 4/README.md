Read a file (BS.txtPreview the documentView in a new window) of integers into an array list so that it is sorted from lowest to highest.  Using console input allow a user to enter a number to search for within the array list using a binary search using recursion (a must).  Your code (.java file) and console screenshot showing the execution need to be provided for full credit.  Your program will determine if the number is found or not found; if found, the index of the element it is in.  The following numbers should be used in testing your program (all of these need to be turned in):

7532
