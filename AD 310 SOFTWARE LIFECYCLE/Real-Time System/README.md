Using one diagram of your choosing, produce a high-level design for an autonomous (self-driving) car.  It only needs to drive and not park or do anything fancy.  Just have it drive down the road not getting hit and not hitting anybody or anything.

The diagram should contain the main components and how they communicate with each other (provide the messages that could occur between components).
