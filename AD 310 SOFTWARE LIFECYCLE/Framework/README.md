Research a generally available framework.  As a team review that framework and its components.  Using zillow.com as a model, write a brief report (with a numbered or bulleted list) of what component of that framework you would/could use to develop a web app such as zillow.com.  Use the web version of zillow since the mobile one would require a different set of components that are not as easily understandable without a knowledge of android or ios architectures.

Submit your report.  No code or design is required, only a list of the components.

Let me know if you have any questions.
